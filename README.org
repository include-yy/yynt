* yynt --- a simple Org publish manager

(If you are familiar with Org-mode and have used Org's export and publishing
features, I hope this package can be helpful when needed; otherwise, it might
not be very useful at the moment.)

Just like =ox-publish=, =yynt= is a management tool for exporting Org files to
other types of files (such as HTML, Markdown). It allows for the management of a
series of Org files and their associated resource files by writing publication
configurations. For building a blog, such management tools can help us retain
the original directory structure, generate HTML at the target location, and move
the associated resource files.

** Features

Compared to ox-publish, yynt has the following advantages and disadvantages:

*PROS*

- Project-local Cache File and More
- More Flexible Export Options Configuration
- Able to Describe Simple File Dependencies
- Clear Directory Structure Differentiation

*CONS*

- More Complex Configuration Options
- Does not support sitemap and =:make-index=
- First Generate In-Place and Then Publish(PROS maybe)

** Installation
