* yynt --- a simple Org publish manager

(If you are familiar with Org-mode and have used Org's export and publishing
features, I hope this package can be helpful when needed; otherwise, it might
not be very useful at the moment.)

Just like =ox-publish=, =yynt= is a management tool for exporting Org files to
other types of files (such as HTML, Markdown). It allows for the management of a
series of Org files and their associated resource files by writing publication
configurations. For building a blog, such management tools can help us retain
the original directory structure, generate HTML at the target location, and move
the associated resource files.

** Features

Compared to =ox-publish=, =yynt= has the following advantages:

- Project-local Cache File and More
- More Flexible(Complex) Export Options Configuration
- Able to Describe Simple File Dependencies
- Clear Directory Structure Differentiation

** Design

** Installation

#+begin_src text
M-x package-vc-install https://github.com/include-yy/yynt RET
#+end_src

=yynt= is not an out-of-the-box package; you need to write publication rules
according to your needs (which might require hundreds of lines of Elisp :p ).

** Configuration
